              <p class="text-34">teamLab is an interdisciplinary art collective that explores the relationship between nature and humans through digital technology. At their Borderless Museum, the Aerial Climbing exhibit features paths of connected swing-like boards. Visitors can walk along these suspended paths, and the surrounding projection will change in response to their movements in real time.

                I knew I wanted to emphasize the branching paths and align teamLab's greater interest in the interaction of humans and nature. I first thought about making use of the original birds, and having them fly along these paths more directly. The more acute angles in the path however could make the motion of the birds somewhat robotic looking. I then thought about flowers, but teamLab already has several exhibits with the growth of static flowers. 
                <br><br>
                When thinking about nature in motion, I felt that having a river flowing through the paths would be a great fit for the exhibit.

              <p class="text-34">This was a really fun project where I was able to tackle an experimental product. I learned how I could think about users interacting more subtly with the environment around them, even with limited ability to actually go out and interview people. I additionally learned about how there's many different ways to technically solve a problem— it was important to understand my high level role in the bigger picture and prioritize communicating my idea in the short 3 weeks.</p>
