    Made with Unity <br>
    <br>
    As a <a href="https://www.teamlab.art/">teamLab</a> interactive team intern, 
    I was tasked with creating a new projection prototype for the 
    <a href="https://www.teamlab.art/w/colored-birds">Aerial Climbing exhibit</a>
    at their <a href="https://borderless.teamlab.art/"> Borderless Museum</a> in
     Tokyo. The exhibit features paths of connected swing-like boards. Visitors 
     can walk along these suspended paths, and the surrounding projection will
     change in response to their movements in real time.

     ^ The Aerial Climbing exhibit with the original projection 
     <br>
     <br>
     The projected birds currently avoid the visitors, but this interaction is
     nonobvious. 

     My proposal for the content was instead to create a river on the paths
     where users walk. 

     The flow of the river increases as more people walk along
     the given path, and decreases overtime if no one visits it.

      <br>
     Each visitor is given a particular color when they enter the space. Their color
     will flow through the river ahead of them. 

     As they walk, flowers will bloom
     along the sides of the river, and then disperse as they pass.
     <br>
     <br>
     The visitors are simulated through the movements of the blue capsule. 
     The river flow changes based off of the visitor/capsule position and 
     velocity. 

     I worked individually to conceptualize and program the prototype.
     The flower assets were created previously by teamLab, but all other elements
     of the prototype were created from scratch.
