      As a <a href="https://www.teamlab.art/">teamLab</a> interactive team intern, 
      I was tasked with creating a proposal for a new projection in the
      <a href="https://www.teamlab.art/w/colored-birds">Aerial Climbing exhibit</a>
      at their Tokyo <a href="https://borderless.teamlab.art/"> Borderless Museum</a>. This prototype was created in Unity over 3 weeks.
    <br><br>

     The visitors are simulated through the movements of the blue capsule. 
     The river flow changes based off of the visitor/capsule position and 
     velocity. 

     I worked individually to conceptualize and program the prototype.
     The flower assets were created previously by teamLab, but all other elements
     of the prototype were created from scratch.

      At their <a href="https://borderless.teamlab.art/"> Borderless Museum</a>, artworks fluidly move between rooms and influence one another. The movements of the visitors can change the artworks-- flowers bloom as you walk and a stream of water dynamically moves around the visitors feet.
      <br><br>
      The <a href="https://www.teamlab.art/w/colored-birds">Aerial Climbing exhibit</a> features paths of connected swing-like boards. Visitors 
       can walk along these suspended paths, and the surrounding projection will
       change in response to their movements in real time.

    <div class="bold">Problem: </div>The problem with this projection is that the interaction between the visitors and birds isn't obvious. Though the projection is dynamic, updating in real time based on the visitors' positions, it's not particularly noticable that the animation isn't pre-recorded.
    <br><br>
    <div class="bold">Goal: </div>
    My task was to create a proposal and prototype for a new projection in which the interaction is much clearer.

        <div><h2>Analysis</h2></div>
        <br><br>
        I first thought about what was working for the original projection. Though the birds seem to be flying in outer space, the birds themselves connect with teamLab's greater theme of nature. The darkness of the projection also helps give the illusion that the swings are suspended higher in the air. In a brighter environment, it would be much easier to see the floor and perceive depth. The colorful circles marking the visitor's location also seems like a positive feature, since it clearly shows that the exhibit is following the position.

        <br><br>
        But what wasn't going right? I took a closer look at the video and made some observations.

        I first noticed that the visitors were looking down at their feet. The birds avoid the visitors and are mostly on the walls, so the most interesting part of the projection is often missed. It therefore makes sense that the main visual feature of the projection would happen around the visitors' feet.

        <br>
        I also made some observations on what makes the Aerial Climbing exhibit unqiue. Most teamLab exhibitions use computer vision to track visitors position in the gallery space, so it felt important to focus on the unqiue qualities of this particular exhibit in my new proposal.

      The exhibition has set routes that people can travel down, which is very different from the other exhibitions where people can walk around anywhere in the room.
      <br><br>
      People also generally move forward in one direction, the projection could encourage people to move forward and flow through exhibition.

      <br><br>
      I thought about what could happen along the branching paths that also aligned with teamLab's greater interest in the interaction of humans and nature. I first thought about making use of the original birds, and having them fly along these paths more directly. The more acute angles in the path however could make the motion of the birds somewhat robotic looking. I then thought about flowers, but teamLab already has several exhibits with the growth of static flowers. When thinking about nature in motion, I felt that having a river flowing through the paths would be a great fit for the exhibit.

        My proposal for the content was instead to create a river on the paths
         where users walk.

         The flow of the river increases as more people walk along
         the given path, and decreases overtime if no one visits it.
         Each visitor is given a particular color when they enter the space. Their color will flow through the river ahead of them. 

         As they walk, flowers will bloom along the sides of the river, and then disperse as they pass.

      I first had to make a simulation of people moving through the exhibit paths, since it wouldn't be practical to test with real people as I made it.
      The blue capsules represent the moving people.

        A river is created along the paths people walk on. The river is visually similar to the water in other teamLab exhibitions, as seen <a href="https://www.teamlab.art/w/iwa-waterparticles/">here</a>.

        Though the simulated people walk robotically, the prototype is programmed so that the river dynamically forms no matter where the person walks. I've also add some noise to the river flow so it's more wavy.

        The exhibit should have a river flowing through the paths before anyone starts walking on it, so I made it possible to save the river data and then load it when you start up the exhibition. You can also see here the river flow is stronger on the paths that the visitor walks on.

        The final component was adding flowers that bloomed along the river as visitors walked. The flower assets were created by other employees at teamLab. The flowers bloom and then die as you walk.
