            Team project with Alexis Soto and Phillip Wang.
            <br><br>
            Over a two week process our team performed user research on the food truck and food cars along Carnegie Mellon campus. We conducted interviews and observations, synthesized our findings, and created personas, scenarios, and storyboards. This research will be the driving force behind a responsive website design focused on easing some of the consumer issues revolving around the Carnegie Mellon-based food trucks and cars.
