        My concept for the project came about while I was listening to a song that felt really nostalgic. The nostalgia I had made me think about the close relationship between emotions, memory, and sound. I wanted to create a space where these sound memories could live. Each orb of sound in the space is related to a specific memory I have. None of the sounds were made for this project, some are found online while others are ripped from existing videos I have.
