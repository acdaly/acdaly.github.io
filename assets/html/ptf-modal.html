             A new interactive display for the fictional transportation hub, “Atlantis Transportation Hub”, to show their plane, ferry, and train transportation data. The hub connects to the San Juan Islands off the coast of Washington State.
            <br><br>
            The hub has come out with a new program, the “PTF Pass”, that customers can use to combine plane, train, and ferry connections.
            <br><br>
            The display is touch screen, and is about 22.5 in x 36 in.

          I was given transportation data for the three different modes of transport: plane, train, and ferry.

          I then started to analyze the transportation and persona data to find patterns, to find ways of grouping the info, and to determine which information was important and relevant. My findings are below:

          <div><h2>Wireframes</h2></div>
          <br>
          <div>I started to brainstorm different ways to organize the data with a few different wireframes.</div>
          <br><br>
          </div>
        </div>
        
          
          
          <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="height-100 col-md-10"><p class="bold">Wireframe 1:</p> I first tried to organize the departures by destination. If someone hadn't already planned their trip, it would be easier to plan when the display is ordered by destination, since the viewer could look through just the relevant connections and compare their departure times.  </div>
          </div>
          <br>
          <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <img class="height-100 col-md-5" src="assets/images/ptf/sketch1.jpg" alt="First Wireframe">
            <img class="height-100 col-md-5" src="assets/images/ptf/sketch2.jpg" alt="Second Wireframe">
          </div>
          <br><br>
          <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="height-100 col-md-10"><p class="bold">Wireframe 2: </p>
            I then thought that it would be better to take some of the work off of the users. In my previous prototype, the users would need to look at the map and then figure out for themselves how to connect the different legs of the trip together to get to their destination. 
            <br><br>
            In this prototype, the user would just need to select their final destination and the next screen would show the different ways they could be connected together. The icons would show if you could get to the destination directly, and which modes of transport would need to be used and combined. </div>
          </div>
          <br>
          <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <img class="height-100 col-md-5" src="assets/images/ptf/sketch2.jpg" alt="Third Wireframe">
            <img class="height-100 col-md-5" src="assets/images/ptf/sketch4.jpg" alt="Fourth Wireframe">
          </div>
          <br><br>
          <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="height-100 col-md-10"><p class="bold">Wireframe 3:</p>
            The grid of the previous iteration made the user have to skim through both horizontally and vertically to find their destination. It was also visually confusing with the many icons.
            <br><br>
            In this iteration, it's very clear that the user can interact with the user interface because there are obvious buttons to press. This design is much cleaner than the previous ones, though it does use arrows to indicate whether the destination can be reached directly or with a connection.
          </div>
          </div>
          <br>
          <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <img class="height-100 col-md-5" src="assets/images/ptf/sketch5.jpg" alt="Fifth Wireframe">
          </div>
          <br><br>
          <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="col-md-10">
          <div><h2>Black and White Designs</h2></div>
            <br>
          </div>
        </div>
          <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="col-md-10"><p class="bold">Iteration 1:</p>
            
            I took this last iteration and made a black and white digital version. To take advantage of the screen real estate, I added a non-interaction display of the data on the left side. This way, multiple users can look at the display and find their information even if someone is interacting with it. It also allows users that are looking for one particular connection (for instance if they already bought their tickets) and immediately find it without having to go to a different page.
            <br><br>
            I made some smaller changes as well-- I removed the arrow icons, as they were unintuitive, added the "Have the PTF Pass?" text to make it clear the flights found on the portal accept the pass, and changed the "Choose your destination" to "Choose your final destination" so it's clear that users should enter final destination as opposed to their next connection.

            <div class="col-md-10">
            I added a gutter between the left and middle columns to make each section more distinct. I also added an asterisk to the relevant rows to make the note at the bottom more noticable when necessary, and gave the ferry departures their own box to make the sub-sections more clear. In addition, the columns are left aligned to give make them easier to scan down.

              I added color to differentiate the sections for the different modes of transport, to make the important flight statuses stand out (boarding, delayed, and cancelled), and to emphasize the * notes. I also created more hierarchy in the text.

              I tried out adding different colors to the right side of the screen, but ultimately felt that this made the screen too colorful. It isn't necessary to reference the sections on the left side of the screen when using the far right interactive one, so I ended up leaving the right side monochromatic.

              In the final design I altered the section colors to be more blue to make the overall color palette more cohesive. The section colors are now more vibrant to greater differentiate them from each other, and the background is darker so the white text is more legible. I added a scroll bar to the detail page so that users can plan their trips later in the day. There were a few other minor changes made, such as tweaking text alignment.

              Since this touch screen display updates with the changing data and user interaction, my final task was to create some animations to demonstrate the way the display updates. The user gets some feedback when they press a button through the darker button color, and is then able to scroll through the information just as they would on their phone.

              The information on the left side slowly fades in and out so the user has time to see the update, and the flight information moves upward so the user can see that the rest of the information stays the same.
