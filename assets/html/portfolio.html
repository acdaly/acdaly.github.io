            My creative technologist personal portfolio website. The home screen waves were programmed in P5.js and can be viewed on their own <a href="aridaly.com/color-waves/Color_Final">here</a>.
            <br><br>
          
          <div class="line"></div>
          <br>
          As a designer and programmer, I wanted to create portfolio website that would showcase my skillset. 
          I wanted the website to include sections for: recent projects, project archive, resume, about me, contact information, and links to Github and LinkedIn.

          <br><br>
          Stylistically I wanted to:
          <ul>
            <div class="bullet">Make a site that's easy to navigate and creatively designed</div>
            <div class="bullet">Immediately show viewers my skillset and style in the home page</div>
            <div class="bullet">Showcase recent projects</div>
            <div class="bullet">Create a project archive to show the depth of work (in progress)</div>
            <div class="bullet">Create an about page that gives insight to what I'm like as a person</div>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <img class="height-100 col-md-5" src="assets/images/portfolio/wireframes1.jpg" alt="First Wireframe">
            <img class="height-100 col-md-5" src="assets/images/portfolio/wireframes2.jpg" alt="Second Wireframe">
          </div>
          <br><br>
            I created some wireframes to start. I wanted to create a one page website where it was very clear when you've seen all of the information. I didn't want to hide certain parts of the website, since each section is important to understanding me and my work.
         <br><br>
          <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <img class="height-100 col-md-10" src="assets/images/portfolio/mid-fi.jpg" alt="Mid-fi Prototype">
          </div>
          <br><br>
            I then coded this prototype, which can be seen live <a href="http://aridaly.com/pui-work/final_project/"> here</a>. I'd originally thought I should take advantage of the interactivity of the website by making my resume interactive, but I decided to remove it in the end, since it seemed unnecessarily complicated. 
            <br><br>
            <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <img class="height-100 col-md-10" src="assets/images/portfolio/prototype-1.png" alt="Hi-fi Prototype">
          </div>
          <br><br>
          In the first prototype's homepage, I used a carousel to move between various project images. The connect page was a black and white version of programmatic animation I made.

          <br><br>
          <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <img class="height-100 col-md-10" src="assets/images/portfolio/2.gif" alt="Home page GIF">
          </div>

          <br><br>
          I realized I wanted to have a more expressive home page, and used the color version as the home screen. I then changed the background of the rest of the site to the same black shade to make the different sections flow together more seamlessly.
          <br><br>
           I additionally made other tweaks: I made the featured images vertical to make it easier to scan the page and better showcase the project images, removed the hobbies section of the about page, as it was a bit too distracting, and moved the link to my resume to the about page.
          <br><br>
          <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <img class="height-100 col-md-10" src="assets/images/portfolio/1.png" alt="Home page GIF">
          </div>
          <br><br>
          This site is still in progress-- I'm currently experimenting with adding another section to the site to showcase my UI/UX design projects, as I'm interested in shifting my work into that direction.
