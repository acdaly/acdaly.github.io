            <div class="inline">
            Our team was challenged to create a responsive website design for the food trucks in the Carnegie Mellon area. To better understand the needs of food truck consumers, we conducted interviews and observations, synthesized our findings, and created personas, scenarios, and storyboards over a two week period. 
            <br><br>
            This research was used to determine how a website could improve consumer experiences. We created CMU To Go, a responsive website design that will inform food truck consumers of whether the truck is open, its typical hours, and give consumers the ability to order their food for pickup.

              <h3>How can we improve the consumer experience at the local food trucks and cars?</h3>
              <br>
              <p>We first set out to identify what motivated consumers to eat at the local food trucks and cars, and what issues there are in their current experience. We decided to narrow our scope to the food trucks and cars along Carnegie Mellon campus, since these dining options are frequented by many students, but much of the information about them is hard to find online.

                Customers said they were much less likely to go to these vendors when the weather was bad. Since there's nearby indoor seating and the walk to these vendors is comparable to other campus dining options, the main issue with bad weather wass the time spent waiting in line and for food.

                Customers didn't go to the food trucks and cars when they don't have cash on them, but these vendors all accept alternate pay options (venmo, credit card, or online payment). These options are not well advertised, so customers are not aware they can pay without cash.

                  <br><br>
                  In the city, Darren grew accustomed to a having a variety of reasonably priced vegetarian options within walking distance, and had a hard time adjusting to the lack of options in Pittsburgh and particularly around campus. His daily struggle is finding a good, quick meal at a reasonable price.

                  In the winter months, Darren finds that even snow will not deter him from visiting the trucks, especially as they are so close to his housing. He admits, however, that the dreary Pittsburgh rain will cause him to seek indoor options instead.

                  Joy grew up in the Bay Area. Her parents are first generation immigrants from China, so she grew up eating Chinese food at home. She is often going from activity to activity, so she rarely has time to cook. She is disappointed by the choices of Chinese food in Pittsburgh, but especially of campus food, and enjoys authentic Chinese food from the food cars once a week.

                  <br><br>
                  Though Paula has left the days of eating with a student meal plan behind, she does still get food at the food trucks on Margaret Morrison Street. She doesn't visit the trucks too often anymore, but she gets food from the trucks on the way to work once or twice a month when she's coming in late.She's less inclined to visit the trucks during the colder months, and especially when the weather is particularly bad.

We had thought about having a peer-to-peer delivery option, but decided that was more of a mobile app feature and that being able to order for pickup would alleviate the main issue of the food truck/car experience when the weather is bad.

              We looked at Yelp, and cmuEats, Grubhub, and Postmates to understand current design conventions and how our website stands out from existing sites.
              <br><br>
              cmuEats is a Carnegie Mellon specific website that is popular for many students. It displays the on campus dining options and whether or not they are open. Its popularity shows the need for a similar hub of information for the campus food trucks and cars.

              <br><br>
              We created a user testing protocol with a few different tasks and questions. We conducted user testing with 4 different Carnegie Mellon students, and our main take aways were the following:
              <br><br>
              <ul>
                
                <div class="bullet">When asked to order a vegetarian curry for pickup, <p class="bold inline">all users clicked on "View Menu" before "Preorder".</p> The two pages are almost identical, making testers more confused on their difference.</div>
                <br>
                <div class="bullet">Testers were <p class="bold inline">confused by the word "Preorder",</p> associating it with ordering an item that hasn't been released yet.</div>
                <br>
                <div class="bullet ">In our overview page of the different vendors, we created two different sections for the "Food Trucks" and "Food Cars". Testers were confused by <p class="bold inline">what defined a "Food Car".</p></div>
                <br>
                <div class="bullet ">In the Q&A section of the testing, multiple users mentioned that <p class="bold inline">they would have liked a general map with the locations of all the vendors.</p> There actually was one on the site, but it was in the "Locations" page of the hamburger menu, which users did not come across during their tasks.</div>
            
              </ul>

              <div class="col-md-12">
                Our team's user testing findings made it clear that changes needed to be made, so we discussed the updates we would make to the pages. My teammate added the menu, and then I took the initiative to implement the rest of the changes.
