            <div class="inline">
            Our team was challenged to create a responsive website design for the food trucks in the Carnegie Mellon area. To better understand the needs of food truck consumers, we conducted interviews and observations, synthesized our findings, and created personas, scenarios, and storyboards over a two week period. 
            <br><br>
            This research was used to determine how a website could improve consumer experiences. We are now in the process of creating a responsive website design that will inform food truck consumers of whether the truck is open, its typical hours, and give consumers the ability to preorder their food.

              <h3>How can we improve the consumer experience at the local food trucks and cars?</h3>
              <br>
              <p>We first set out to identify what motivated consumers to eat at the local food trucks and cars, and what issues there are in their current experience. We decided to narrow our scope to the food trucks and cars along Carnegie Mellon campus, since these dining options are frequented by many students, but much of the information about them is hard to find online.

                Customers said they were much less likely to go to these vendors when the weather was bad. Since there's nearby indoor seating and the walk to these vendors is comparable to other campus dining options, the main issue with bad weather wass the time spent waiting in line and for food.

                Customers didn't go to the food trucks and cars when they don't have cash on them, but these vendors all accept alternate pay options (venmo, credit card, or online payment). These options are not well advertised, so customers are not aware they can pay without cash.

                  <br><br>
                  In the city, Darren grew accustomed to a having a variety of reasonably priced vegetarian options within walking distance, and had a hard time adjusting to the lack of options in Pittsburgh and particularly around campus. His daily struggle is finding a good, quick meal at a reasonable price.

                  In the winter months, Darren finds that even snow will not deter him from visiting the trucks, especially as they are so close to his housing. He admits, however, that the dreary Pittsburgh rain will cause him to seek indoor options instead.

                  Joy grew up in the Bay Area. Her parents are first generation immigrants from China, so she grew up eating Chinese food at home. She is often going from activity to activity, so she rarely has time to cook. She is disappointed by the choices of Chinese food in Pittsburgh, but especially of campus food, and enjoys authentic Chinese food from the food cars once a week.

                  <br><br>
                  Though Paula has left the days of eating with a student meal plan behind, she does still get food at the food trucks on Margaret Morrison Street. She doesn’t visit the trucks too often anymore, but she gets food from the trucks on the way to work once or twice a month when she’s coming in late.She’s less inclined to visit the trucks during the colder months, and especially when the weather is particularly bad.

We had thought about having a peer-to-peer delivery option, but decided that was more of a mobile app feature and that being able to order for pickup would alleviate the main issue of the food truck/car experience when the weather is bad.
